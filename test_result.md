Testing Protocol:
- MUST test AI chat functionality after any changes
- MUST verify authentication flow works completely  
- MUST ensure original UI/UX design is preserved
- Backend testing can use curl commands for API verification
- Frontend testing should verify complete user journey from login to AI interaction

Incorporate User Feedback:
- User wants to utilize ALL backend features (59+ services)
- Make app "actually functional not fake functional"  
- Fill gaps between frontend and backend
- Preserve existing UI/UX and workflow
- Focus on connecting existing advanced backend capabilities to frontend
