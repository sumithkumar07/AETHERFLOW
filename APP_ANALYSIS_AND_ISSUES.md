### ‚ùå **Critical Issues Identified**

## üö® **Priority 1: Business Model Inconsistencies**

### Issue 1: Conflicting Messaging
**Problem:** Landing page shows "FREE unlimited AI access enabled via Puter.js!" but we've implemented paid-only plans.

**Impact:** 
- Users will be confused when they hit subscription paywall
- False advertising / misleading marketing
- Poor user experience and potential churn

**Evidence:**
```
Landing Page: "üü¢ FREE unlimited AI access enabled via Puter.js!"
Subscription Plans: Basic ($19), Professional ($49), Enterprise ($179)
```

**Problem:** No clear path from landing page to subscription selection.

**Impact:**
- Users don't understand value proposition
- No guided trial experience
- Poor conversion rates

## üö® **Priority 2: Subscription System Issues**

### Issue 3: Backend Integration Missing
**Problem:** Subscription page is just a frontend mockup with no real functionality.

**Current State:**
```javascript
// Frontend makes API calls but gets "coming soon" message
toast.error('Subscription system coming soon!')
```

**Impact:**
- Users can't actually subscribe
- No revenue generation possible

```
User Request ‚Üí Groq API ‚Üí Response
```

**Should Be:**
```
User Request ‚Üí Check Subscription ‚Üí Check Usage Limits ‚Üí Groq API ‚Üí Track Usage ‚Üí Response
```
